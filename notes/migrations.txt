migrations.txt

Ways of migrating: 
  
  doing it by hand.
A developer would write python and SQL scripts
 that updates the database to the subsequent specifications.

Django allows us to automatically migrate from one version of 
  a databse than another.

why use migrations?
  -- what if we want to change the model
    -- we can do it in SQL but it is error prone and can be hard
    to reverse and maintain.
    -- we also have the option to rebuild the DB each time.

Activating Apps

What Django needs to use models

A model must have a table, 
how do we get Django to make a table for model for us?

-- add app that has model to the INSTALLED_APPS folder.
  -- one of the biggest things that people forget.
  -- the error is cryptic, so check INSTALLED_APPS first upon error
  and install virtual-environment

ONE MIGRATION
-- make them first, then apply them. 
-- scripts that create the database are stored in a migrations directory

-- WORKFLOW
  -- change model, make migrations, migrate.
  -- if you have to add data when migrations occur, 
    a python shell will open prompting you to add data.
  -- migrate command is interactive by design.
